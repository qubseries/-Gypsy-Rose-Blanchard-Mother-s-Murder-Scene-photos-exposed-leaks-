After the recent leak of disturbing crime scene photos related to the murder of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, Gypsy Rose Blanchard has significantly reduced her presence on social media. The 33-year-old, who had been actively posting on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, deleted more than half of her posts towards the end of July 2024, following the viral spread of these images.

The leaked photos, which show various parts of Dee Dee‚Äôs home, including blood-stained bed sheets and her deceased body, have caused shock and outrage online. This has led to a shift in public sentiment, with many former supporters of Gypsy Rose withdrawing their support. TikToker Noah Glenn Carter warned his followers not to search for the photos, stating that those who had previously supported Gypsy were now abandoning her after seeing the graphic images.

Gypsy Rose, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for her role in the 2015 murder of her mother, was released after serving seven years. Her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, received a life sentence for his involvement. The resurfacing of the crime scene photos has reignited public interest and debate around the case, leading to renewed scrutiny of Gypsy's actions and her subsequent release.

Gypsy Rose's story is one of extreme psychological and physical abuse. Her mother, Dee Dee, convinced doctors and those around them that Gypsy suffered from numerous severe health conditions, a manifestation of Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA). Dee Dee's manipulation began when Gypsy was just a few months old, and she spent her entire childhood and early adulthood under her mother's control.

Dee Dee's actions led to Gypsy being homeschooled, isolated, and forced to use a wheelchair despite being physically healthy. Dee Dee's control extended to preventing Gypsy from attending school, further isolating her and ensuring that she remained dependent on her mother. The extreme nature of Dee Dee's abuse culminated in the tragic events of 2015, when Gypsy and Godejohn conspired to murder Dee Dee.

The renewed attention on this case, spurred by the leak of the crime scene photos, has brought to light the complex and tragic circumstances surrounding Gypsy Rose Blanchard's life and the difficult questions surrounding her culpability and the justice served.
